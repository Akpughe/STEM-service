## Explanation
Certainly! Let's solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0\) using the quadratic formula. 

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The standard form of a quadratic equation is given by:
\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
In our equation, we can identify the coefficients as follows:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = 7\)
- \(c = -15\)

### Step 2: Write down the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation and is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, \(b^2 - 4ac\) is known as the discriminant.

### Step 3: Calculate the discriminant
First, we need to calculate the discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac\):
\[
D = 7^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-15)
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
D = 49 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-15) = 49 + 120 = 169
\]

### Step 4: Apply the quadratic formula
Now that we have the discriminant, we can substitute \(a\), \(b\), and \(D\) into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2 \cdot 2}
\]
Calculating \(\sqrt{169}\):
\[
\sqrt{169} = 13
\]
Now substituting this back into the formula:
\[
x = \frac{-7 \pm 13}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for the two possible values of \(x\)
Now we will calculate the two possible values for \(x\):
1. For the plus sign:
\[
x_1 = \frac{-7 + 13}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
2. For the minus sign:
\[
x_2 = \frac{-7 - 13}{4} = \frac{-20}{4} = -5
\]

### Final Answer
The solutions to the equation \(2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0\) are:
\[
x = \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -5
\]

### Explanation of Key Concepts
1. **Quadratic Formula**: This formula provides a method to find the roots of any quadratic equation. It is derived from completing the square on the general quadratic equation.
2. **Discriminant**: The discriminant \(D\) determines the nature of the roots:
   - If \(D > 0\), there are two distinct real roots.
   - If \(D = 0\), there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).
   - If \(D < 0\), there are no real roots (the roots are complex).
   In our case, since \(D = 169 > 0\), we have two distinct real roots.

### Relevant Mathematical Insights
- The quadratic formula is a powerful tool in algebra that allows for the solution of quadratic equations without needing to factor them, which can be particularly useful when the roots are not easily identifiable.
- Understanding the discriminant helps in quickly assessing the nature of the roots without necessarily calculating them.
- Quadratic equations appear frequently in various fields, including physics, engineering, and economics, making the ability to solve them a valuable skill.

This thorough approach ensures a solid understanding of the process and the concepts involved in solving quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.
