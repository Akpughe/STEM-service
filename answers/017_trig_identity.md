## Explanation
Certainly! Let's simplify the expression \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) \) step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Trigonometric Identity
The expression \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) \) is a well-known trigonometric identity. It states that for any angle \( x \):

\[
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
\]

### Step 2: State the Final Answer
Based on the identity, we can conclude that:

\[
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
\]

### Step 3: Explanation of Key Concepts
1. **Trigonometric Functions**: The functions \( \sin(x) \) and \( \cos(x) \) represent the sine and cosine of an angle \( x \), respectively. These functions are fundamental in trigonometry and are defined based on the unit circle.

2. **Unit Circle**: The unit circle is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate plane. The coordinates of any point on the unit circle can be represented as \( ( \cos(x), \sin(x) ) \), where \( x \) is the angle measured from the positive x-axis.

3. **Pythagorean Identity**: The identity \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 \) is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. In the context of the unit circle, the radius of the circle is 1, and any point on the circle satisfies the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Here, \( x = \cos(x) \) and \( y = \sin(x) \).

### Step 4: Verification of the Result
To verify the identity, we can consider specific values of \( x \):

- For \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  \sin(0) = 0, \quad \cos(0) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin^2(0) + \cos^2(0) = 0^2 + 1^2 = 0 + 1 = 1
  \]

- For \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \):
  \[
  \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \quad \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1
  \]

- For \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \):
  \[
  \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
  \]

In all cases, we find that \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 \).

### Educational Insights
- **Importance of Trigonometric Identities**: Trigonometric identities like \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 \) are fundamental in various fields of mathematics, including calculus, physics, and engineering. They simplify calculations and provide insights into the relationships between angles and their corresponding sine and cosine values.

- **Applications**: This identity is frequently used in solving integrals, differential equations, and in the analysis of periodic functions. Understanding and memorizing such identities is crucial for success in higher-level mathematics.

In conclusion, the simplified form of \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) \) is \( 1 \).
