## Explanation
Certainly! Let's simplify the expression \((2 + 3i)(4 - i)\) step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Components
The expression consists of two complex numbers:
- \(2 + 3i\) where \(2\) is the real part and \(3i\) is the imaginary part.
- \(4 - i\) where \(4\) is the real part and \(-i\) is the imaginary part.

### Step 2: Use the Distributive Property (FOIL Method)
To simplify the product of two complex numbers, we can use the distributive property, often referred to as the FOIL method (First, Outside, Inside, Last). 

The product can be expanded as follows:
\[
(2 + 3i)(4 - i) = 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot (-i) + 3i \cdot 4 + 3i \cdot (-i)
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Each Term
Now, let's compute each term:
1. **First**: \(2 \cdot 4 = 8\)
2. **Outside**: \(2 \cdot (-i) = -2i\)
3. **Inside**: \(3i \cdot 4 = 12i\)
4. **Last**: \(3i \cdot (-i) = -3i^2\)

### Step 4: Substitute \(i^2\)
Recall that \(i^2 = -1\). Therefore, we can substitute this into the expression:
\[
-3i^2 = -3(-1) = 3
\]

### Step 5: Combine All Terms
Now, we can combine all the computed terms:
\[
8 - 2i + 12i + 3
\]
Combine the real parts and the imaginary parts:
- Real parts: \(8 + 3 = 11\)
- Imaginary parts: \(-2i + 12i = 10i\)

### Final Answer
Thus, the simplified form of \((2 + 3i)(4 - i)\) is:
\[
\boxed{11 + 10i}
\]

### Explanation of Key Concepts Used
1. **Complex Numbers**: A complex number is of the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) is the real part and \(b\) is the imaginary part. Here, \(i\) is the imaginary unit with the property that \(i^2 = -1\).
2. **Distributive Property**: This property allows us to multiply each term in the first complex number by each term in the second complex number.
3. **Combining Like Terms**: After expanding, we combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately to get the final result.

### Educational Insights
- **Complex Multiplication**: When multiplying complex numbers, it is important to keep track of the real and imaginary parts separately. This helps in avoiding mistakes and ensures clarity in the final result.
- **Visualization**: Complex numbers can be represented on the complex plane, where the x-axis represents the real part and the y-axis represents the imaginary part. This geometric interpretation can provide deeper insights into operations involving complex numbers.

This thorough approach not only simplifies the expression but also reinforces the understanding of complex number operations.
