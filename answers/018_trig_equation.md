**Status:** ✓ Success

## Result
### Original Query
```
Solve sin(x) = 0.5 for x in [0, 2π]
```

## Explanation
Sure! Let's break down the problem of solving the equation \( \sin(x) = 0.5 \) for \( x \) in the interval \( [0, 2\pi] \).

### 1. Understanding the Problem
The equation \( \sin(x) = 0.5 \) is asking us to find all angles \( x \) within the interval from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \) radians (which is equivalent to \( 0 \) to \( 360 \) degrees) where the sine of those angles equals \( 0.5 \). The sine function is periodic and oscillates between -1 and 1, and it has specific values at key angles.

### 2. Solution Method
To solve this, we typically use the properties of the sine function and a reference angle. The general approach involves:
- **Identifying the reference angle** for which the sine value is known.
- **Determining all possible angles** in the specified interval that correspond to that reference angle.

### 3. Steps Explained
1. **Find the Reference Angle**: 
   The reference angle where \( \sin(x) = 0.5 \) is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \) (or \( 30^\circ \)). This can be found by recalling the unit circle or using a calculator.
   
2. **Determine All Solutions**: 
   The sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. Therefore, we need to find two angles:
   - The angle in the first quadrant: \( x = \frac{\pi}{6} \).
   - The angle in the second quadrant: \( x = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \).

So, the two solutions for \( \sin(x) = 0.5 \) in the interval \( [0, 2\pi] \) are:
\[ x = \frac{\pi}{6} \]
\[ x = \frac{5\pi}{6} \]

### 4. Why This Approach Works
This approach works because of the periodic nature and symmetry of the sine function. The sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, and by finding a reference angle, we can easily deduce the corresponding angles in both quadrants. The unit circle is a useful tool here because it visually represents the angles and their sine values.

### 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Ignoring the Quadrants**: It's important to check all quadrants where the sine function is positive.
- **Miscalculating Reference Angles**: Ensure that the reference angle is correctly identified; \( \sin^{-1}(0.5) \) should lead you to \( \frac{\pi}{6} \).
- **Not Keeping Within the Interval**: Always be mindful to find solutions only within the specified range — here, \( [0, 2\pi] \).

### 6. Real-World Application
One practical application of sine functions is in wave motion, such as sound waves or light waves. For example, if a sound wave has a peak intensity when described by \( \sin(x) \), determining when that intensity reaches a specific value (like \( 0.5 \)) can help in settings like audio engineering or acoustics, where understanding sound waves is crucial.

In summary, solving trigonometric equations involves understanding the unit circle, identifying reference angles, and being aware of the periodic properties of the sine function. By following these steps, you can effectively solve similar equations!
