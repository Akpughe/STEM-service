## Explanation
Sure! Let's solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Quadratic Equation
The given equation is a quadratic equation of the form:
\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
where:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -5 \)
- \( c = 6 \)

### Step 2: Use the Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation and is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
We will substitute \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into this formula.

### Step 3: Calculate the Discriminant
First, we need to calculate the discriminant \( D \):
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
D = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1
\]

### Step 4: Apply the Quadratic Formula
Now that we have the discriminant, we can find the roots:
\[
x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
1. \( x_1 = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
2. \( x_2 = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)

### Final Answer
The solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are:
\[
x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 2
\]

### Explanation of Key Concepts Used
1. **Quadratic Equation**: A polynomial equation of degree 2, which can be solved using various methods including factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.
2. **Discriminant**: The part of the quadratic formula under the square root, \( b^2 - 4ac \), which determines the nature of the roots:
   - If \( D > 0 \): Two distinct real roots.
   - If \( D = 0 \): One real root (a repeated root).
   - If \( D < 0 \): No real roots (two complex roots).
3. **Quadratic Formula**: A universal method for solving any quadratic equation, regardless of whether it can be factored easily.

### Relevant Mathematical Insights
- **Factoring**: The quadratic \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \) can also be factored as \( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \). This shows that the roots can be found by setting each factor to zero, which is often a quicker method if the quadratic is easily factorable.
- **Graphical Interpretation**: The solutions \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) correspond to the x-intercepts of the parabola represented by the equation \( y = x^2 - 5x + 6 \). The graph of this quadratic opens upwards (since \( a > 0 \)) and intersects the x-axis at these points.

This thorough approach provides a complete understanding of how to solve the quadratic equation and the underlying concepts involved.
