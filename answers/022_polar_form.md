## Explanation
To convert the complex number \( 1 + i \) to polar form, we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding Polar Form
The polar form of a complex number is expressed as:
\[
z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the modulus (or absolute value) of the complex number,
- \( \theta \) is the argument (or angle) of the complex number.

This can also be expressed using Euler's formula:
\[
z = re^{i\theta}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Modulus \( r \)
The modulus \( r \) of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by:
\[
r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]
For our complex number \( 1 + i \):
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 1 \)

Calculating \( r \):
\[
r = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Argument \( \theta \)
The argument \( \theta \) is found using the tangent function:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{b}{a}
\]
For \( 1 + i \):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]
To find \( \theta \), we need the angle whose tangent is 1. This occurs at:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \quad \text{(or 45 degrees)}
\]

### Step 4: Write in Polar Form
Now that we have both \( r \) and \( \theta \), we can express \( 1 + i \) in polar form:
\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right)
\]
Using Euler's formula, this can also be expressed as:
\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}}
\]

### Final Answer
The polar form of the complex number \( 1 + i \) is:
\[
\sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \quad \text{or} \quad \sqrt{2} e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}}
\]

### Key Concepts Used
1. **Modulus**: The distance from the origin to the point in the complex plane.
2. **Argument**: The angle made with the positive real axis, measured in radians.
3. **Polar Coordinates**: A way of representing complex numbers that can simplify multiplication and division.

### Educational Insights
Understanding the polar form of complex numbers is crucial in complex analysis, as it simplifies operations like multiplication and division. In polar form, multiplying two complex numbers involves multiplying their moduli and adding their angles, while dividing involves dividing their moduli and subtracting their angles. This property is particularly useful in solving integrals and differential equations in the complex plane. 

By converting complex numbers to polar form, we can also visualize them as points or vectors in the complex plane, enhancing our geometric understanding of complex numbers.
